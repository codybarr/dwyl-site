# Huh...?

This directory contains the script that _generates_ the `home.html` file
in the _root_ of the repository.

To run the script you will need to be connected to the internet
as it will "_scrape_" the `README.md` of: https://github.com/dwyl/home

```sh
node _home/compile.js
```

You should see:
```
 done.
```

(_if you see anything else, please try to debug it locally,
  and if you're still scratching your head, open an issue on GitHub!_)
